List-In is a application that allows a user to generate and curate lists of content that pertain to a particular topic. List-In encourages both fellowship and curiosity by allowing you to not only create and populate lists, but to copy and share your lists with your friends as well! A user's lists will be either generated by their own hand or copied from another user's inventory. 

While using List-In, you will see a feed on the right side of your home page. This is a resource showing you recently added lists from those that you follow. Feel free to see who is following your inventory and click on their avatars to view what lists they possess. 

No installation of any kind necessary. Just sign-up/login and enjoy!
